Group F2022-11.

The Project explores the connections between artists by performing a network analysis of related artists using the Spotify API. The primary objective is to construct a network representation based on the related artists data and visualize it for further analysis. The study reveals insights into the interconnectedness of artists and identifies prominent clusters and influential figures within the network.

The visualization of the artist network provides a comprehensive overview of the music ecosystem and can potentially inform music recommendation systems, artist collaborations, and understanding the dynamics of cultural influence within the music industry. The findings from this research contribute to the field of music data analysis and network analysis, shedding light on the collaborative nature of the music industry and offering valuable insights for various applications.
